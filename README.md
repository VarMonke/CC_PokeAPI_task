# Wrapper over PokeAPI to serve type multipliers

## Task A

This isis used to generate the data from the given pokemon.txt.

## Task B
This uses the `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/<type>` API endpoint to generate a type matrix that is used to host an API that serves type multipliers.

There is already a pre-generated multipliers.json that the `multiplier.py` will use. A new one can be generated by running `generate_multipler.py`
